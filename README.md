# Masquerade.
## Add real value to NFTs

### Built for the Chainlink Spring 2021 Hackathon
 &nbsp;     
 ## What is it?
Masquerade is a platform which leverages Chainlink to build NFTs which hide a secret - encrypted information encoded directly into the image. Simply provide an image and your plaintext data and Masquerade will handle the rest, minting you a shiny new NFT with your information safely stored within!

 &nbsp; 

## How does it work?
Visit the Masquerade portal, provide an image file and your plaintext data, then submit. Your request will be sent to the Chainlink node, the data will be encryped then encoded into the NFT image. From this, NFT metadata is created and sent to the Masquerade token contract for minting.

As an NFT, your token is able to be freely transferred and traded. When you want to redeem the information, simply return to the portal and burn the token to unlock the encoded data via private data delivery. 

### Technology Used
- Chainlink Nodes, External Initiators, External Adapters.
- create-eth-app for front-end.
- NFT smart contracts (ERC721) from OZ.
- Polygon (MATIC) L2.

## Deliverables
Operation system on the Polygon testnet (Mumbai) with minting/burning capability.
